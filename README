This project tends to provide a registration portlet for GateIn Portal based on 
JSF/Richfaces. The idea is to implement a JSF alternative to the existing portlet 
where a new user can register. The problem to solve is that the current portlet is
WebUI based and requires WebUI knowledge to be modified. The new solution should be
flexible enough so that it doesn’t require to be recompiled to do most standard
customizations (adding/removing captcha support, adding/removing fields…). Also 
the new application should be smooth and be a 2010 application (Ajax), not a 1990 old-style.


1) If you don't have maven installed yet, so start with downloading and installing 
   it, you find all steps for that in the link below, to ensure that it was 
   correctly installed, open a terminal window and type the following command :
   
   ~home$ mvn --version
   
   and you should have something like this (run on Mac OSX) :
   
      Apache Maven 2.2.1 (r801777; 2009-08-06 21:16:01+0200)
      Java version: 1.6.0_22
      Java home: /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
      Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: MacRoman
      OS name: "mac os x" version: "10.6.5" arch: "x86_64" Family: "mac"
   
   
   NB : if you are using Windows OS, please refer to Maven website for more
        details about how to install and configure Maven.
   
   Download link : http://maven.apache.org/

2) Once installed and configured, open a command line prompt and go to the project
   install directory. Type the command below :
   
   	~projectHome$ mvn clean install
   
   this should take a while until maven resolve all dependencies and downloads
   needed libraries, note that this is only for the first build because maven
   install libs locally.

3) Once built, you should have a war file under directory "target" which you
   can deploy on your GateIn portal server. If you are using GateIn with JBoss AS
   you just need to copy the web archive into the deploy directory
   (~/jboss-as-dir/server/default/deploy)
   
4) To register the portlet, please refer to GateIn tutorial. Note that it is
   recommended to add the portlet to application layout and not to a specific
   page, otherwise only the that page will be tracked.
   
5) After registering and adding the portlet to a page, you should have an awesome 
   register portlet.
     
6) Now it is ready to work !
